# UserBase

This project was based on a prompt sent by a friend.

The user can create and access multiple categories (up to three levels), in which users are divided.

The categories can be acessed by the navigation menu on the left of the screen. Content is shown in the middle, on the form of tables of users if the category can receive them, or links if the category has any subcategories.

Categories and users are pulled from raw-data and persisted on app state only.

Built with NextJS.
